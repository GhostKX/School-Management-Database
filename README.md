## Code Structure  

### Student Database Management  

- Student records are managed in an **SQLite database** table called `students`, where entries can be added, removed, updated, or displayed.  
- The database schema includes:  
  - **id** (Primary Key) – Auto-incremented student ID.  
  - **first_name** – Student’s first name.  
  - **last_name** – Student’s last name.  
  - **age** – Student’s age.  
  - **grade** – Student’s academic grade.  

### Class & Function Implementation  

The system is implemented using **functions** to handle student operations:  

- **`add_student()`** – Adds a new student after validating input.  
- **`get_student_by_name()`** – Searches for students by first or last name.  
- **`show_all_students()`** – Displays all students in the database.  
- **`update_student_grade()`** – Updates a student's grade using their name or ID.  
- **`delete_student()`** – Deletes a student record based on name or ID.  

Each function interacts with the SQLite database to ensure **data consistency and persistence**.
